# make a `me`

I've been watching [rwxrob](https://rwx.gg)'s SKILSTAK Boost for reference
tonight, and he recommends creating a `me` repository for self-documentation.

He recommends including things like:

* Zettelkasten
* Posts
* CV
* Lab work

It could be useful as a source of truth for static site generation, I could
roll it into an eventual website I build as a git submodule.
